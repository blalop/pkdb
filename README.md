You know, that kind of general CS stuff that find yourself googling like twice a week?

Tired of having myself googling the same things so often, and inspired by [wezm's pkb](https://github.com/wezm/pkb), I decided to write with a Jenkins blog where I can easily publish and share some of the knowledge I'm able to keep only for the three hours after searching.This is this blog.

## Local testing

Like every other Jekyll site:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
